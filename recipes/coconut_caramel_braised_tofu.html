            <li>1small shallot, minced (¼ cup)</li>
            <li>2tablespoons minced garlic</li>
            <li>1tablespoon peeled minced ginger (from one 1-inch piece)</li>
            <li>1cup unsweetened full-fat coconut milk, stirred</li>
            <li>2tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce</li>
            <li>2tablespoons white miso</li>
            <li>1tablespoon turbinado sugar</li>
            <li>1/4cup chopped scallions, plus more for garnish</li>
            <li>1tablespoon lime juice, plus wedges for serving</li>
            <li>Steamed rice and hot sauce, for serving</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In a 12-inch nonstick skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil over medium-high. Add green beans, season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and lightly charred in spots, about 5 minutes. Transfer green beans to a plate.</li>
            <li>Add 1 tablespoon of the oil and the tofu to the skillet and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden, about 5 minutes. Push tofu to one side of the skillet and reduce heat to medium. To the empty side, add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil, the shallot, garlic and ginger; stir until well combined and coated in the oil, then mix into the tofu until well incorporated.</li>
            <li>Add coconut milk, soy sauce, miso and sugar and bring to a simmer, mashing the miso until it dissolves. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook, stirring occasionally, until sauce reduces and resembles caramel, about 5 minutes. Stir in reserved green beans, ¼ cup scallions and 1 tablespoon lime juice; season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Divide braised tofu and green beans over rice. Garnish with more scallions and serve with lime wedges.</li>
        </ol>
